# reset-task: discard ONLY the uncommitted work of the last task
#
# Unlike a branch reset, this one is SURGICAL: it throws away only the changes
# not yet committed (the half-done task interrupted by a stop/crash) and
# PRESERVES every commit of the previous tasks and the branch. It is the correct
# cleanup for the task planning protocol (.claude/docs/01-task-planning.md).
#
# Usage:  ./scripts/reset-task.sh          # show what it would discard and ask
#         ./scripts/reset-task.sh --yes    # discard without asking (automation)
