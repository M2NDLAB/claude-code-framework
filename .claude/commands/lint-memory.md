description: Consistency health-check of the memory/wiki — finds contradictions and misalignments and proposes the correction
---
Run a LINT of the persistent memory (`.claude/memory/`) and of the process
pointers: a health-check of the CONSISTENCY of the knowledge base, on: $ARGUMENTS
(if empty: on the whole memory).

This is NOT a process retrospective (`/retro`, see @.claude/docs/06-self-improvement.md):
the retro proposes WHAT TO IMPROVE in the workflow; the lint verifies the HEALTH of the DATA.
**When to run it** (see the cycle in @.claude/docs/00-overview.md): NOT at every
deliverable — periodically, normally together with the periodic retrospective on the
IMP backlog, and after events that touch many notes at once (big merges,
restructurings of the memory, wide rewrites of `STATE.md`).
**Resolution criterion**: this is a framework for software — a contradiction
is a BUG, not a tension to preserve. The lint FLAGS and PROPOSES the correction,
always aligning the state to reality (never the other way round — unless reality violates
a rule: then it is a process bug, not a memory bug, and it goes to escalation/IMP).

## Checks
1. **State vs reality.** Is `STATE.md` (progress, "Active branches", "What exists")
   aligned with git? Verify with `git branch`, `git branch --merged <integration>`,
   `git log --oneline -10`: branches given as existing but already merged/deleted,
   features "in progress" that turn out to be already committed, a stale "last".
2. **Contradictions between notes.** Decisions (`decisions/`), component notes
   (`components/`) and session notes (`sessions/`) that contradict each other or
   `STATE.md`.
3. **Stale claims.** Statements made obsolete by more recent facts (a decision
   superseded by a later one without the first being marked as such).
4. **Orphan pages.** Notes with no incoming reference (not cited by `INDEX.md`
   nor by a `[[wikilink]]` from other notes): either they are to be linked, or they are dead.
5. **Concepts without a page.** Concepts/components cited repeatedly in the notes but
   lacking a page of their own — candidates for a dedicated note.
6. **Missing cross-references.** Clearly related notes not linked by a
   `[[wikilink]]`; `INDEX.md` not listing notes that actually exist.
7. **Broken links.** `[[wikilink]]` pointing at non-existent notes.
8. **Consistency of `TREE.md`.** Aligned with the real structure of the filesystem
   (regenerable as per `/checkpoint`).
9. **`LEARNINGS` ↔ `STATE` consistency.** The recorded items are aligned between the
   files: a deferred IMP whose trigger is near or blocking also appears among the
   open issues of `STATE.md` (and vice versa); the debt accepted by the security
   gate (docs/03) lives in `STATE.md` with its reason; every debt entry has its
   explicit TRIGGER, it is not generic.
10. **Grep-visible `[TO BE DEFINED AT SETUP]` markers.** No *slot* to be filled in
    is broken by word-wrap across two physical lines: it would escape the
    `grep -rnE "TO BE DEFINED AT SETUP|DA DEFINIRE AL SETUP" .` of the setup
    (`SETUP.md`, §2) and of Step 4 of the upgrade, silently staying unfilled.
    Sentinel: `grep -rnE "TO BE DEFINED AT$|DA DEFINIRE AL$" .` — every hit is a
    candidate. The Italian form is recognised as LEGACY: projects grafted
    before the release that introduced the English marker do not break. KNOWN false positives to ignore (prose that *discusses* the
    marker, not a slot): the guidance box of `SETUP.md` and the IMP records of
    `LEARNINGS.md`. A hit elsewhere, or one that really is a fillable slot, must be recompacted
    onto a single physical line (convention in `SETUP.md`, §2).
11. **Inventories vs reality.** Do the inventory-lists ENUMERATED below correspond
    to the filesystem? Set comparison in BOTH directions: an entry that EXISTS but is missing
    from the inventory; an entry LISTED but non-existent. ONLY the enumerated
    lists are checked — never the prose mentions elsewhere (it is the enumeration that avoids
    list-vs-prose false positives):
    (a) files in `.claude/commands/` ↔ the "Quick commands" list of `CLAUDE.md` and,
        where present, the `commands/` line of the "Structure" of `README.md`;
    (b) PROCESS targets of the `Makefile` ↔ the same lists. Process ones = the
        recipe invokes a script from `scripts/` (STRUCTURAL anchoring, not
        positional: it holds even when the setup fills in or removes the
        `[TO BE DEFINED AT SETUP]` banner); `help` is excluded (a meta-target that prints the
        list) and the PROJECT targets (build/test/run of the stack) are OUT OF
        scope — never flag them;
    (c) files in `scripts/` ↔ the table of `scripts/README.md`.
    An entry counts also in an equivalent form (`make reset-task` ≡
    `./scripts/reset-task.sh`). A mismatch = BUG (lint semantics): the doc is aligned
    to reality. Excluded by declaration, as in check 10 (they record PAST
    states, not inventories of the current state): the append-only documents
    (`CHANGELOG.md`) and the IMP records of `LEARNINGS.md`. In client projects
    only the files copied from the template count (the `README.md` of the framework is not
    among them).

## Output and resolution
A table: **Area | Problem found | Type** (misalignment / contradiction /
orphan / broken link / stale claim) **| Proposed correction**.

- **Mechanical, low-risk corrections** (regenerating `TREE.md`, reconciling
  "Active branches" with git, adding a missing `[[wikilink]]`, fixing a broken
  link): APPLY them and say so.
- **Cases that require judgement** (which of two contradictory notes is the right
  one, which claim is the true one): PROPOSE and ask for confirmation, do not guess.

If a misalignment reveals a PROCESS hole (not just a data one), record it as an
IMP in `LEARNINGS.md` (docs/06): it is the only bridge between the lint and the retrospective.
